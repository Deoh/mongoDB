# Code Institute (Data Centric Development) - MongoDB

## Manipulate Data Programmatically With Python
- mongo.py
The basics of how to do CRUD, create, read, update, and delete using Python to access MongoDB.
(in gitpod an env.py needs to be created then placed into .gitignore)

## 	Manipulate Data With A Custom User Interface (For our walkthrough project in the MongoDB unit)
- mongo_project.py
Build a simple frontend to interface with our database.
This frontend will allow us to perform all of the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, but through a menu-driven interface.
We're going to build a couple of helper functions to assist us.
And this also will combine all of what we've learned with regard to MongoDB and Python so far.
